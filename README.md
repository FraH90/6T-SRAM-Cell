# 6T SRAM Cell

Simulation of a 6T SRAM cell using Orcad Capture and PSPICE (student edition).

Install the "AMS" library in the "PSPICELibs" folder in order to open and run the simulation.

In the "screen" folder there are various screenshots of the simulations, showing the signals during reading and writing operations.
